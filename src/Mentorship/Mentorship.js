        <p>The Wings to Fly mentorship program supports a scholarâ€™s holistic development through four facets; encouraging academic excellence, developing a value-centered life, nurturing transformative leadership and embracing a culture of giving back.</p>
        <p>Mentorship is offered at three different capacities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>University student mentors carry out school visits and monitor academic performance. They are mainly alumni of the program.</li>
            <li>Through forums facilitated by CSSBs and Equity Bank, parents, guardians and Equity Bank staff engage with mentors and scholars. These are career talks and giveback activities that aim to impact the community positively.</li>
            <li>In the Annual Education and Leadership Congress, cohorts of Wings to Fly scholars come together for week-long intensive, inspiring and educative forums where they get to learn from the role models in society such as successful professionals, government persons, entrepreneurs, and community leaders.</li>
        </ul>
